# hello-world
My first git hub repo

Hey! I started out as a blogger, which meant you had to know a little HTML or CSS in order to make things work. From there, I built on the very small web 1.0 skills I had to jump into the web 2.0 content revolution, normally understanding and adapting new technologies for legacy media organizations and launching a few digital media orgs. I went to work in television and learned production. Then I went to Stanford on a Knight Fellowship and watched how technology was reshaping the entire world. 

After Knight, I knew I wanted to do more with the hardware and software side, but it was slower going. I worked more TV jobs and I am now on hiatus to learn some more. The last job with ESPN/Disney exposed me to AR/VR and Machine Learning and I'd like to combine my past skills into something that incorporates all the skills I've learned thus far to make new creative technology. I don't really want to be a coder, but learning some of the skills is a very efficient way to create new works.
